# Builtattic Marketplace MVP â€” Backend Checklist

Detected 3 Node projects in the uploaded Dashboard.zip.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Choose the server folder to run (where `express` & `mongoose` are present).
2. Create `server/.env` with **fresh** Mongo, JWT, SMTP, Razorpay, Cloudinary.
3. `cd server && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run dev`

- Vendor payouts accounting (report first; automate later).
